# ShoeLlama

 I am developing a Multi-Agent RAG system for footwear recommendations and care, powered by Llama 3, Qwen2.5, LlamaIndex and LangChain. I am currently working on hybrid search methods, prompt engineering and web search. Plans to use MCP server for scalable processing, real-time responses, and continuous model improvement for personalized recommendations.
